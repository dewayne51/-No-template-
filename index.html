 My Name is Dewayne, ive recently turned 36 years of age this month.
  ive decided to learn code to open career avenues for myself and develop skills i can also utilise in my personal life.
  <br>
  <br>
  After leaving high school i went on to study mechanical/manufacturing engineering at college, followed by a 1.5 year stint in university studying engineering product design.
  <br>
  <br>
  I then went on to work in the construction industry as a building services CAD (computer aided design) technician, then into project management, whilst also completing a HNC in mechanical engineering in my own time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to this point i am currently working as a mechanical project manager at a climate systems contracting company. My work generally involves organizing project operations, hiring subcontractors, finalising designs for installations, overseeing progress and ensuring the project is delivered on time and to budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside of work i enjoy staying active and fit, with the gym, mountain biking or hiking
